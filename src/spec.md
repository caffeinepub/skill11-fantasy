# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build an MVP for Skill11 Fantasy, a low-entry cricket fantasy sports platform focused on IPL matches with team creation, contest entry, real-time scoring, and wallet management.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for user registration and login
- Create IPL match listing with live score updates
- Build fantasy team creation interface (11 players, role constraints, 100-credit budget, captain/vice-captain selection)
- Display low-entry contests (₹10–₹100) with entry system and wallet deduction
- Integrate Stripe payment gateway for wallet deposits (₹10–₹10,000 range)
- Implement scoring engine with real-time point calculations based on cricket performance metrics
- Create live leaderboard showing contest rankings and final results with winners
- Build wallet system tracking deposits, contest entries, winnings, and transaction history
- Design mobile-first UI with vibrant sports-inspired colors (greens, oranges, reds), bold typography, and energetic card-based layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can register via Internet Identity, view upcoming/live IPL matches, create fantasy cricket teams within budget constraints, join low-entry contests by paying from their wallet (recharged via Stripe), track real-time scores and leaderboard rankings during matches, and manage their wallet balance with full transaction history.
