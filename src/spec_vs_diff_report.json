  "summary": "The diff implements a functional Fantasy Cricket platform with Internet Identity authentication, IPL match listings, fantasy team creation with role constraints, contest entry system with entry fees, Stripe payment integration, backend scoring engine, leaderboard interface, and wallet management. The implementation covers all 9 core requirements with appropriate frontend UI components, backend storage, and payment processing. The mobile-first design uses cricket-themed colors (greens, oranges, gold) as specified. Some acceptance criteria remain unverifiable from diff alone (real-time score updates, actual scoring calculations), but the architectural foundation is in place.",

      "reason": "While the Match type includes status field and the frontend has refetchInterval set, there's no evidence of actual integration with a live cricket data API or websocket connection to push real-time scores. The scoring engine code is truncated, so cannot verify if real-time updates are implemented.",

      "reason": "The backend file is truncated before showing the scoring engine implementation. While the Participant type includes points field and there's mention of scoring rules, the actual calculation logic for runs, wickets, catches, strike rate, economy rate with captain/vice-captain multipliers is not visible in the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "While the leaderboard displays rankings and the LeaderboardRow component has a prizeAmount prop, there's no evidence in the diff of automatic winner declaration logic or prize distribution when a match concludes. The backend code is truncated and doesn't show match completion handling or winnings credit automation.",
